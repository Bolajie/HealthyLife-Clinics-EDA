## Project Overview
HealthyLife Clinics is a chain of outpatient healthcare facilities dedicated to enhancing patient outcomes through personalized care, efficient treatment plans, and preventive healthcare initiatives. With a growing patient base, the organization generates significant amounts of data on patient demographics, medical conditions, treatment outcomes, service delivery, and patient satisfaction‚Äîdata that has been previously underutilized.

This project thoroughly analyzes and synthesizes this information to uncover key trends and operational insights that will help HealthyLife Clinics optimize patient care, streamline operations, and improve overall healthcare efficiency. By leveraging data analytics, this study provides actionable recommendations to enhance clinical decision-making and resource management, ultimately supporting HealthyLife Clinics‚Äô mission of delivering high-quality, patient-centered care

## Business Problemm and Key Question
1. What are the most common medical conditions treated?
2. Are there any noticeable trends in patient demographics (age, gender, 
location)?
3. How effective are treatments based on patient outcomes?
4. What is the average duration and cost of treatments for different 
conditions?
5. Are there seasonal patterns in patient visits or conditions?
6. How can clinic operations be optimized to enhance patient experience and 
outcomes?

## Tools and Technique Used
**Excel:** Data cleaning, pivot tables, Power Pivot, Data Modeling, Data Classification,<br>trend analysis, Dashboad Creation and Data Visualization visualizations. </br>
- **Description:** In this project, I analyzed healthcare data to uncover patterns in common medical conditions, demographic insights, treatment effectiveness, and seasonal trends in patient visits. 
- **Key Insights:**
  - Anxiety is the most frequently treated condition, followed by Flu and Hypertension.
  - Seniors are more likely to experience chronic conditions, while adults show higher rates of anxiety and diabetes.
  - Therapy is the most effective treatment for Anxiety, whereas Surgery has mixed outcomes for various conditions.
  - Autumn sees the highest patient visits, peaking in September 2024.
- **Demo Overview:**
  I built this project to explore healthcare data trends and identify key insights that could support better decision-making in patient care. Using SQL, I cleaned and structured the dataset, and with Power BI and Tableau, I visualized trends in patient demographics, treatment effectiveness, and cost distribution. My analysis highlights how different age groups experience medical conditions and how treatment methods vary in effectiveness. This project demonstrates my ability to extract meaningful insights from healthcare data and present them in an accessible way.
